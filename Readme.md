# Granular Synthesizer

A Granular Synthesizer with an upcoming, no yet made, architecture. Which pretends to run on a microprocessor, such as the RPI, and use the GPIO of the Raspberry to receive input from different manual controlls(knobs, sliders, buttons, etc) in order to change the parameters in real time of the Synth.
